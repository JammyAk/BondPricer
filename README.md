**Simple Bond Maths:**

A fixed-rate bond pays a consistent coupon periodically until maturity, at which point the face value (principal) is repaid.

A zero-coupon bond does not make periodic interest payments. Sold at a discount to its face value and matures at par.

A floating-rate bond pays a coupon that varies with a reference interest rate, such as LIBOR or SOFR.

Bond Pricing with Yield Curve - Instead of using a single yield (YTM) for discounting, you can use a yield curve, where each cash flow is discounted using a different rate corresponding to its maturity.
